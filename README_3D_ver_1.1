- Current release: March 2012 (extension version 1.1, built on HotSpot v.5.0)

All changes to the code are commented with "BU_3D" (grep'ing BU_3D should list
all changes).  Multiple-line changes are marked with BU_3D and end->BU_3D.

"FIXME"s demonstrate the ongoing work. 

Changes with respect to extension version 1.0:
----------------------------------------------
- [FIXME]: det3D_grid_reference det3D_grid_values[64][64]. The grid reference
  data structure should be the same size as the grid.  right now its 64x64 by
default. We will make it variable if the user changes size of grid.

- [FIXME] In the next version, we will compute joint resistivity values for the
grid cells bordering between two blocks with different resistivity values.
Currently the resistivity of the default layer over-writes the resistivity of
such border cells, if there are any. Therefore, if a TSV block is small, it may
be ignored in the simulation. However, considering the impact of small TSV
blocks is limited, the accuracy loss for the current version is expected to be
low.

- Added 3Dfig.pl which has similar functionality to tofig.pl but instead reads in 
an .lcf files and creates a .FIG file for each floorplan listed in the .lcf file.
Additionally, it will show a unit's resistivity and capacitance if it specified
in the floorplan file.

-usage: 3Dfig.pl [-a <area ratio>] [-f <fontsize>] [-s <nskip>] <file>
converts the floorplan file into 'FIG' format and prints to stdout
[-a <area ratio>] -- approx page occupancy by figure (default 0.95)
[-f <fontsize>]   -- font size to be used (default 10)
[-s <nskip>]      -- no. of entries to be skipped in input (default 0)
<file>            -- input .lcf file (eg: example.lcf)

- Alternatively, the command to convert 'example.lcf' into a PDF is
3Dfig.pl example.lcf | 3Dfig2pdf.sh output.pdf

 


On-going work:
---------------------------
- [FIXME]: We will add check statements to prevent errors when user enters
  unreasonable values for cp and res or a meaningless # of numerical
parameters.

- [FIXME]: liquid cooling interface

How to Specify lcf and flp files:
---------------------------------
- The .lcf file format is the same as the default HotSpot 5.0
	#File Format:
	<Layer Number>
	<Lateral heat flow Y/N?>
	<Power Dissipation Y/N?>
	<Specific heat capacity in J/(m^3K)>
	<Resistivity in (m-K)/W>
	<Thickness in m>
	<floorplan file>

	#Example
	0	
	Y
	Y
	1.75e6
	0.01
	0.00015
	ev6.flp.orig

- There is a slight change in the format of the floorplan file (.flp) that allow units in
the floorplan to have different specific heat and resistivity

# Line Format: <unit-name>\t<width>\t<height>\t<left-x>\t<bottom-y>\t<specific-heat>\t<resistivity>
# all dimensions are in meters, comment lines begin with a '#',
# comments and empty lines are ignored
# Example
Unit1	0.002000	0.002000	0.000000	0.000000	4e6	.02294

- Use the 3Dfig.pl and 3Dfig2pdf.sh to verify your floorplans.

How to Run :
-----------
>> ./hotspot -c hotspot.config -f <filename> -p <powerfile> -steady_file <steadyfile> -model_type grid -detailed_3D on -grid_layer_file <lcffile> 
>> ./hotspot -c hotspot.config -init_file <steadyfile> -f <filename> -p <powerfile> -o <ttracefile> -model_type grid -detailed_3D on -grid_layer_file <lcffile>




Included Test Cases :
---------------------
The included test cases consist of TIM layers where a block in the flp has a
number of TSVs. We first compute the resistivity for the block with TSVs. In
order to find the resistivity based on TSV density, we calculate the joint
parallel resistivity (of Cu and TIM) in the following way:

( ((% area of block w.o. TSVs) * (1/TIM Resistivity)) + ((% area of TSVs) * (1/Cu Resistivity)) )^-1

Test files are in the following folders:
default3D: No TSVs
3D_2percent: TSV density of 2 percent of the block area
3D_10percent: TSV density of 10 percent 

TSV density can be computed based on number of TSVs, TSV dimensions, and pitch
constraints between TSVs for a given 3D system. 

Note that it is also possible to have blocks with and without TSVs in the same
layer (see 3D_10percent_v2) or to model each TSV directly. The user should
specify each TSV in the floorplan and provide the Cu resistivity and capacity
values for modeling individual TSVs.

Also note that most of the included test cases only have TSVs in the TIM layer
(no TSVs in the Si layers). Depending on the design, TSVs may connect the
active layers of each Si layer; therefore some of the Si layers may have TSVs
in the bulk Si.  It is possible to model such cases using this tool. See
3D_2percent_v2 as an example.

We do not modify the capacity of the layer in these experiments. The change
in specific heat capacity is expected to have lower impact compared to that
of the thermal resistivity. Capacity values, however, can also be modified in
this tool if needed.
